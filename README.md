# KubeAid Bootstrap Script

The `KubeAid Bootstrap Script` is used to bootstrap Kubernetes clusters using Cluster API and [KubeAid](https://github.com/Obmondo/KubeAid).

> Currently it only supports bootstrapping self-managed clusters in AWS.

## Official Guides

- [Bootstrapping a self-managed cluster in AWS](https://github.com/Obmondo/KubeAid/blob/master/docs/aws/capi/cluster.md)

## Developer Guide (AWS)

> Make sure, you've Docker installed in your system.

Run `make build-image-dev` to build the KubeAid Bootstrap Script container image (development version).

Then run `make run-container-dev` to run the container.

In a separate terminal window, use `make exec-container-dev` to execute into the container.

Once you're inside the container, use `make generate-sample-config-aws-dev` to generate a sample config file at [./outputs/kubeaid-bootstrap-script.config.yaml](./outputs/kubeaid-bootstrap-script.config.yaml), targetting the AWS cloud provider. Adjust the config file according to your needs.

Export your AWS credentials as environment variables and then run `make bootstrap-cluster-dev` to bootstrap the cluster!

### Debugging

- Check ClusterAPI related pod logs.

- SSH into the control-plane node. In case of AWS, you can view cloud-init logs stored at `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`.

## TODOs

- [ ] Check Git URL if SSH agent is used.
- [ ] Validation for sshagentauth (should not accept https url).
- [x] `--debug` flag to print command execution outputs.
- [ ] Support adding admin SSH keys via config file.
- [ ] Support using HTTPS for ArgoCD apps.
- [ ] Use ArgoCD sync waves so that we don't need to explicitly sync the Infrastructure Provider component first.
- [x] Support enabling `Audit Logging`.
- [x] Switch to IAM Role from (temporary) credentials after cluster bootstrap.
- [x] ETCD metrics enabled.
- [x] Support scale to / from zero for the node-groups.
  > Currently, I have added extra ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding in the KubeAid [cluster-autoscaler Helm chart](https://github.com/Obmondo/kubeaid/tree/master/argocd-helm-charts/cluster-autoscaler) to support this feature.
  > But I have also opened an issue in the kubernetes-sigs/autoscaler repository regarding this : [Allow adding extra rules to the Role / ClusterRole template of the Cluster AutoScaler Helm chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues/7680).
- [ ] `recover cluster` command
