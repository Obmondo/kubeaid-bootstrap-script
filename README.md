# KubeAid Bootstrap

Welcome to the KubeAid Bootstrap repository! This project aims to simplify the process of setting up a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster across multiple cloud providers. With KubeAid Bootstrap, you can get your cluster up and running in just 10 minutes, complete with essential tools like Keycloak, ArgoCD, Cert-Manager, and monitoring via Kube-Prometheus.

## Features

- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Easily deploy on AWS (Self-managed, EKS), Azure (AKS and self-managed), Hetzner (Cloud, Robot, and Hybrid), and local environments.
- **Latest Kubernetes Version**: Always set up the latest stable version of Kubernetes.
- **GitOps Workflow**: Manage your cluster configuration and deployments using GitOps principles.
- **Integrated Tools**:
  - **Keycloak**: For identity and access management.
  - **ArgoCD**: For continuous delivery and GitOps.
  - **Cert-Manager**: For managing TLS certificates.
  - **Kube-Prometheus**: For monitoring and alerting.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your Kubernetes cluster:

### Prerequisites

- A cloud account for your chosen provider (AWS, Azure, Hetzner).
- `kubectl` installed on your local machine.
- `git` installed on your local machine.
- `docker` installed on your local machine.
- `jsonnet` installed on your local machine.
- `kubeseal` installed on your local machine.
- `k3d` installed on your local machine.
- Access to a terminal or command line interface.

NOTE: You can also run the ./scripts/install-runtime-dependencies.sh

- A git repo to hold your custom settings for your cluster, [kubeaid-config](https://github.com/Obmondo/kubeaid-config)

### Quick Setup

1. **Download the compose file**:
  - Get the compose file
  ```bash
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Obmondo/kubeaid-bootstrap-script/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yaml
  ```

2. **Configure Your Environment**:
  - Setup the .env file
  ```raw
  # cat .env
  CLOUD_PROVIDER=local
  CLUSTER_NAME=kubeaid-demo
  ```

3. **Deploy the local Cluster**:
   - Run the docker compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose run bootstrap-cluster
   ```

4. **Access Your Cluster**:
   - Once the setup is complete, you can access your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`:
   ```bash
   export KUBECONFIG=./outputs/kubeconfigs/main.yaml
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

5. **Access Keycloak, ArgoCD, and Monitoring**:
   - Follow the instructions in the [KubeAid](https://github.com/Obmondo/kubeaid) to access and configure Keycloak, ArgoCD, and Kube-Prometheus.
   - Example: ArgoCD
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server --namespace argo-cd 8080:443
   ```

6. **Destroy**
   - When you are done playing
   ```bash
   k3d cluster delete kubeaid-demo
   ```
