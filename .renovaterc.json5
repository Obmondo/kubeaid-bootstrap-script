    Renovate is based around the concept of package managers. These range from traditional package
    managers like npm, Bundler and Composer through to less traditional concepts like CircleCI or
    Travis config files.

    The goal of Renovate is to detect and maintain all third-party dependencies in your
    repositories, through the use of managers.
