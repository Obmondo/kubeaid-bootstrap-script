# Generating a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

To contribute to this project, you may need to generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the necessary permissions.

Follow these steps to generate a PAT:

1.  Go to your GitHub Settings.
2.  In the left sidebar, click **Developer settings**.
3.  In the left sidebar, click **Personal access tokens**, then click **Tokens (classic)**.
4.  Click **Generate new token**.
5.  Give your token a descriptive name.
6.  Select the scopes, or permissions, you want to grant this token. For contributing to this project, you will likely need scopes related to repositories.
7.  Click **Generate token**.
8.  Copy the token. For security reasons, you won't be able to see it again.

**Important:** Treat your PAT like a password and keep it secure.
